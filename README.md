# .config
Some of my configuration files.

## Automated setup
I've created a bash script that installs all of my preferred tools and saves my configuration locally. \
To run the script, simply run the following command.
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cal-overflow/dotfiles/main/setup.sh)" && source ~/.zshrc
```

<small>Note, this has only been tested on unix-based operating systems with zsh installed.</small>

## [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
Zsh jazzed up with [Oh my ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) is my shell of choice.

## [Neovim](https://neovim.io)

### Notes to self
##### Neovim Configuration
To configure neovim, edit the configuration file located at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. \
Recall: The `~/.vimrc` file is **not** used by Neovim.

##### Managing Plugins
Plugins are configured within `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`. \
A plugin manager must be used in order for plugins to be installed and function correctly. I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for managing plugins. The essential commands are listed below.

```vim
# Install plugins
:PlugInstall

# Cleanup unused plugins
:PlugClean
```

##### Lua
Some "translations" from regular vim config to lua that may be helpful:
| vim | lua |
| :-: | :-: |
| `let g:variable='value'` | `vim.g.variable='value'` |

##### Other dependencies
The following dependencies may be needed for neovim to work properly.
- LTS node
  - pyright npm package
